## Getting Started

Fork this repository or click [<kbd>Use this template</kbd>](https://github.com/DATL4G/Kromex/generate).

Import your new repository into <b>IntelliJ</b> or any other IDE of your choice.

## Create your extension

I provided all modules you need out of the box and even some small examples.

Do whatever you want with it.

#### Make sure to replace "Kromex" with your actual extension name.

## Limitations

It's possible that the code were not generated correctly in some cases.
Please create an issue if you've found any wrong parameter/return type etc.

### Enums

Enums will be generated as well, however if any function/event returns an enum like:

```kotlin
browser.runtime.getPlatformInfo()
```

The enum won't be accessible as such.
Instead, call the ```toString()``` method on it and then create the enum type by this value, e.g.:

```kotlin
browser.runtime.getPlatformInfo().collect {
    console.log(it.os == PlatformOs.linux)
    console.log(PlatformOs.valueOf(it.os.toString()) == PlatformOs.linux)
}
```

This will output:

```
false
true
```

## Build

### Generate APIs

This is useful e.g. if the API specifications changed.

##### Make sure the previous generated files are deleted

```bash
./gradlew :generate:clean
```

##### Generate the files by its specifications

```bash
./gradlew :generate:run
```

### Export your extension

##### Rebuild JS files

This step is not needed if you've edited resource files only.

```bash
./gradlew clean assemble
```

##### Copy needed files to /build/extension

```bash
./gradlew extension
```
